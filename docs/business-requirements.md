# Business Requirements
Why are we working on this problem?

## External

### Data Shares
Duplicate identifiers within an MLS when fed through data shares compound the pain points outlined above. 

### Licensee Interoperability Among Third-Party Products
Multiple records make it difficult for licensees to link account information across the multiple platforms available.  Forms, CMA software, showing systems, lockbox, Single-Sign on products, and even broker back office systems suffer as a result.  
 
## Internal
### Statistical Reports
Reports such as production and market share suffer when individuals have multiple IDs as their productivity can not be accounted for under one, single identifier.  A truly unique ULI will link all licensee records so that statistical data accurately reflects all productivity.  

### Transactional History
As licensees conduct transactions in multiple markets–often with different real estate companies over their careers–it is difficult to confidently combine transactions from the multiple identifiers.   

### Unified Educational Profile
Designations, certification, educational credits, policy compliance, are all made difficult when trying to link this data over multiple licensee records. 
 
Current efforts to create unique identifiers are unable to capture a large segment of real estate licenses due to their focus on Realtor Membership or individual state license numbers.  Additionally, the process to create these unique numbers is prone to human error as demonstrated by individuals with multiple “unique” identifiers.

While various vendors have implemented their own solutions, there is a need for a consistent, industry-wide standard. As a result, the industry needs a hybrid solution that combines technology, organizational collaboration and cooperation to adopt a truly unique identifier.  Thus, the RESO ULI.

# Critical Success Factors
The method MUST
* Generate a truly unique, unchanging identifier
* Be practical to implement
* Protect and enhance personally identifiable information (PII); it cannot contain PII derived from the individual, though it MAY be associated with such information if stored and utilized in a secure manner.
* Be capable of capturing and incorporation of non-associated identifiers (manually or via automated linking via probabilistic matching)
* Be accepted and utilized as a valuable identifier by licensee, managing and owner brokers, MLSs, data syndicators, IDX and other data consumers (NAR, state licensing entities)
* Support one or multiple licenses per individual
* Be scalable
* Support versioning
* Handle multiple license authorities
* Support billions of IDs
* Be removable: PII as necessary
* Protect MLS Roster Data so that only necessary information is available in an encrypted format for the purpose of creating ULI.  To the extent that an individual’s data is visible, said data will only be visible under a high probability match.  Access to bulk roster data is not permissible.
* Be updatable: Accommodate splitting, merging, removal
* Work internationally
